This repo contains notebooks I have created to show specific techniques I used in research and/or teaching.

The link above contains the notebook providing the analysis of of Ultrasound data using Generalised Additive Mixed-effects Modelling presented in a workshop I have presented at LabPhon 2018. 

# R training

## [Introduction to R](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-Introduction-to-R/)

The link above presents the essential part of the workshop **Introduction to R**. This workshop was run as part of the "adventures in R meetup" and was supported by the R Consortium. The training was run in 2018.


## [Techniques in data analyses](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-Techniques-in-Data-Analyses/)

The link above provides links to various sessions I ran as part of the HASS faculty R training workshop at Newcastle University. This forms part of the "Adventures in R" group.
