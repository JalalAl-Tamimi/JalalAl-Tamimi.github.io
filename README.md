This repo contains notebooks I have created to show specific techniques I used in research and/or teaching.

# [Voicing and Gemination - VOT](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-Voicing-Gemination-VOT/)

These notebooks present the analyses performed for the article "Al-Tamimi, J. and Khattab, G., (accepted, in revisions). *Acoustic correlates of the voicing contrast in Lebanese Arabic singleton and geminate plosives*. Invited manuscript for the special issue of Journal of Phonetics, "Marking 50 Years of Research on Voice Onset Time and the Voicing Contrast in the Worldâ€™s Languages" (eds., T. Cho, G. Docherty & D. Whalen)."

Two types of analyses were performed:

1. Linear Mixed Effects Modelling as confirmatory analyses [see notebook](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-Voicing-Gemination-VOT/Voicing%20and%20Gemination%20-%20Mixed%20Effects%20Modelling.nb.html)
2. Random Forests by Conditional Inference Trees as a classification technique [see notebook](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-Voicing-Gemination-VOT/Voicing%20and%20Gemination%20-%20Random%20Forests.nb.html)

The datasets can be accessed here:

1. For [Linear Mixed Effects Modelling](https://github.com/JalalAl-Tamimi/R-Voicing-Gemination-VOT/blob/master/resultsGemination.csv)
2. For [Random Forests by Conditional Inference Trees](https://github.com/JalalAl-Tamimi/R-Voicing-Gemination-VOT/blob/master/ResultsFullOriginalData.csv)

# [Rating experiments](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-Rating-data/)

This [notebook](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-Rating-data/Rating-VQ-Nas-Phonetica.nb.html) contains data and analyses used for a rating experiment (see, Khattab, G., Al-Tamimi, J., and Al-Siraih, W., (2018). "Nasalisation in the production of Iraqi Arabic pharyngeals". Phonetica, https://doi.org/10.1159/000487806)

# [GAMMs](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-GAMM-LabPhon18/)

This [notebook](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-GAMM-LabPhon18/GAMMsLabPhon.nb.html) contains data and analyses used in a workshop I have presented at LabPhon 2018 on GAMMs and their use on Ultrasound data

# [Techniques in data analyses](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-Techniques-in-Data-Analyses/)

This [notebook](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-Techniques-in-Data-Analyses/Session_4-AnalysingData.nb.html) contains data and analyses used in a workshop I have presented at a HASS faculty R training workshop: [AdventuresInR](https://github.com/JalalAl-Tamimi/AdventuresInR) at Newcastle University (dates 7-8 June 2018).
