This repo contains notebooks I have created to show specific techniques I used in research and/or teaching.

# Research

The link above contains the notebooks providing the full analysis of the article: **Al-Tamimi, J. and Khattab, G., (2018). *Acoustic correlates of the voicing contrast in Lebanese Arabic singleton and geminate stops*. Invited manuscript for the special issue of Journal of Phonetics, "Marking 50 Years of Research on Voice Onset Time and the Voicing Contrast in the World’s Languages" (eds., T. Cho, G. Docherty & D. Whalen)." Vol: 71, pp. 306-325. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2018.09.010**


## [Rating experiments](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-Rating-data/)

The link above contains the notebook providing the analysis of the rating experiment with Cumulative Logit Mixed-effects Modelling, presented in the article: **Khattab, G., Al-Tamimi, J., and Al-Siraih, W., (2018). "Nasalisation in the production of Iraqi Arabic pharyngeals". Phonetica, https://doi.org/10.1159/000487806**


## [GAMMs](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-GAMM-LabPhon18/)

The link above contains the notebook providing the analysis of of Ultrasound data using Generalised Additive Mixed-effects Modelling presented in a workshop I have presented at LabPhon 2018. 

# R training

## [R-training full](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-Training/)

The link above presents the full material used during my teaching at undergraduate and master's degree at Université de Paris. The various notebooks build in difficulty, going from basics in R, to the Tidyverse, to visualisations, to statistics. A more advanced session is included (going from linear, to binary logistic regression, to cumulative logit regression for rating data, to linear mixed-effects modelling).

## [Introduction to R](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-Introduction-to-R/)

The link above presents the essential part of the workshop **Introduction to R**. This workshop was run as part of the "adventures in R meetup" and was supported by the R Consortium. The training was run in 2018.


## [Techniques in data analyses](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-Techniques-in-Data-Analyses/)

The link above provides links to various sessions I ran as part of the HASS faculty R training workshop at Newcastle University. This forms part of the "Adventures in R" group.  

## [Introduction to Random Forests](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/Intro-Random-Forests/)

The link above presents material used for the workshop: *introduction to Random Forest* delivered to the group: *[Sounds of Language and Speech: Aarhus University's phonetics and phonology (and more) research group](https://soundsoflanguageandspeech.wordpress.com/)*, on 16th June 2021
